`Observable` on Swift. 
Class: https://github.com/iqbalansyor/ObservableSwift/tree/master/ObservableSwift/Observable

Previous research `ObservableProtocol` on Objective-C: https://github.com/iqbalansyor/ObserverProtocol


#### Limitation of Objective-C:
- Generic type can't provide for primitive type (`BOOL`, `float`, `Void` and etc)


### TODO
- Creating a dummy flow to better understanding using of this class
- Adding documentation how to using this class on `.md`

Create `issue` if anything you want to ask or contribute.

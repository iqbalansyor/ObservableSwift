`Observable` on Swift

Previous research `ObservableProtocol` on Objective-C: https://github.com/iqbalansyor/ObserverProtocol


#### Limitation of Objective-C:
- Generic type can't provide for primitive type (`BOOL`, `float` and etc)


### TODO
- Create a dummy flow to better understanding using of this class


Create `issue` if anything you want to ask or contribute.
